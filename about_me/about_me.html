	<h1>Something I find interesting!</h1>
	<p>Technology and science have always fascinated me. I am a CS student, but I have an AS degree in physics and
		another in mathematics. Something I have recently been heavily interested in is the development in motor
		racing such as <strong>Formula 1</strong>. I have been watching the <a
			href="https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en">Red Bull Racing team</a> while also learning more about how
		the engines, aerodynamics, and engineering come into play.
